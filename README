NAME
    Perl::Critic::Deprecated - Policies and modules that were formerly
    included with Perl::Critic itself, but which have been superseded by
    others.

AFFILIATION
    This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation for
    this distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into a
    bundle. All of the Policy modules contained herein will have an
    "AFFILIATION" section announcing their participation in this grouping.

VERSION
    This document describes Perl::Critic::Deprecated version 1.119.

SYNOPSIS
    Some Perl::Critic policies and modules have had their functionality
    superseded by others and thus merely slow things down when analyzing
    code. They are put here in case anyone still wants/needs to use them.

DESCRIPTION
    The included policies are:

    Perl::Critic::Policy::NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs
        Write "$my_variable = 42" instead of "$MyVariable = 42". [Default
        severity 1]

    Perl::Critic::Policy::NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars
        Write "sub my_function{}" instead of "sub MyFunction{}". [Default
        severity 1]

    Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::RequireRcsKeywords
        Put source-control keywords in every file. [Default severity 2]

INTERFACE
    None. This is nothing but documentation.

    Perl::Critic documentation for how to make use of this.
